Easily create boilerplates for developing interactive plugins in the WordPress standard.

== Description ==
The Interactive Boilerplate Creator allows you to quickly and easily create boilerplates

a basic boilerplate simply providing the plugin name and the author's email address, 
or go further and create a boilerplate that includes the Interactivity API 
in save.js or render.php formats.
