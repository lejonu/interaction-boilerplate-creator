# Interaction Boilerplate Creator

The Interactive Boilerplate Creator allows you to quickly and easily create boilerplates 
that adhere to WordPress standards. By adding 'Create Boilerplate' block to a page, you can create 
a basic boilerplate simply providing the plugin name and the author's email address, 
or go further and create a boilerplate that includes the Interactivity API 
in save.js or render.php formats.
